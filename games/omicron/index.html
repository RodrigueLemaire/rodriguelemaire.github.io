		OMICRON is a small project which tries to create a small minecraft-like engine that you can use to create your own game, in Lua. 
		It's a fork of <a href="http://www.minetest.net/">minetest</a>, an open-source project which follows the same objective, but in a different way. 
		While minetest has many features, too many of them are already harcoded in its C++ core. My objective is to make less things possible hardcoded in it!
		But for now, it's just a small project which has just began, so come and help me making this engine better!
